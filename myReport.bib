    abstract = "In pursuit of the perfect supervised NLP classifier, razor thin margins and low-resource test sets can make modeling decisions difficult. Popular metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, and Recall are often insufficient as they fail to give a complete picture of the model{'}s behavior. We present a probabilistic extension of Precision, Recall, and F1 score, which we refer to as confidence-Precision (cPrecision), confidence-Recall (cRecall), and confidence-F1 (cF1) respectively. The proposed metrics address some of the challenges faced when evaluating large-scale NLP systems, specifically when the model{'}s confidence score assignments have an impact on the system{'}s behavior. We describe four key benefits of our proposed metrics as compared to their threshold-based counterparts. Two of these benefits, which we refer to as robustness to missing values and sensitivity to model confidence score assignments are self-evident from the metrics{'} definitions; the remaining benefits, generalization, and functional consistency are demonstrated empirically.",

abstract = {Incorporating phrase-level sentiment analysis on users' textual reviews for recommendation has became a popular meth-od due to its explainable property for latent features and high prediction accuracy. However, the inherent limitations of the existing model make it difficult to (1) effectively distinguish the features that are most interesting to users, (2) maintain the recommendation performance especially when the set of items is scaled up to multiple categories, and (3) model users' implicit feedbacks on the product features. In this paper, motivated by these shortcomings, we first introduce a tensor matrix factorization algorithm to Learn to Rank user Preferences based on Phrase-level sentiment analysis across Multiple categories (LRPPM for short), and then by combining this technique with Collaborative Filtering (CF) method, we propose a novel model called LRPPM-CF to boost the performance of recommendation. Thorough experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model is able to improve the performance in the tasks of capturing users' interested features and item recommendation by about 17\%-24\% and 7\%-13\%, respectively, as compared with several state-of-the-art methods.},

However, in recent times, the problem of information overload has become more and more marked, and we are now reaching a point where it is becoming increasingly difficult to locate the right information at the right time. One avenue of research that is set to improve information access, and relieve the information overload problem, is to develop technologies for automatically personalising information, both in terms of its content and mode of presentation. In this paper we describe the development of the PTV (Personalised Television Listings—http://www.ptv.ie) system which tackles the information overload associated with modern TV listings data, by providing an Internet-based personalised listings service. PTV is capable of automatically compiling personalised guides to match the likes and dislikes of individual users.}
