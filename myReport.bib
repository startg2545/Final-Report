    abstract = {The Internet has brought unprecedented access to vast quantities of information. However, in recent times, the problem of information overload has become more and more marked, and we are now reaching a point where it is becoming increasingly difficult to locate the right information at the right time. One avenue of research that is set to improve information access, and relieve the information overload problem, is to develop technologies for automatically personalising information, both in terms of its content and mode of presentation. In this paper we describe the development of the PTV (Personalised Television Listings—http://www.ptv.ie) system which tackles the information overload associated with modern TV listings data, by providing an Internet-based personalised listings service. PTV is capable of automatically compiling personalised guides to match the likes and dislikes of individual users.}
